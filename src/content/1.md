### Extended Description
Fullstack system to manage barbershop schedules.

The goal was to develop a backend that would handle all requests from different frontends that were on a whitelist.

Additionally, each frontend would have its own associated database, allowing data isolation between clients.

On the frontend side, there is a calendar that shows available time slots to book appointments at the barbershop.
