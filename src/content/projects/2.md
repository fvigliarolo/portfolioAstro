### Extended Description
I started this project while looking for a solution to a daily problem I faced at my gym. During my boxing training sessions, there were too many students, which overwhelmed the coach and caused delays when I needed to ask about the day's workout routine.

To solve this, I decided to develop a system where the coach could create the daily workout plan, allowing students to access the website and view the routine and training order for each day.

From a technical perspective, one of my goals was to avoid developing a custom backend. To achieve this, I researched existing solutions and discovered Backend as a Service (BaaS) platforms.

After building the frontend for the application, I chose Supabase as the backend. Once the system was complete, I explored free deployment options.

This led to my first deployment using Vercel and my first experience with Backend as a Service.
