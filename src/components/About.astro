    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        As a self-taught developer, I always feel the need to seek solutions
        from a technological perspective. This constant drive to find solutions
        is also what pushes me to keep learning and continuously improve my
        skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        After studying and practicing ethical hacking, I started my current role
        in 2021 as a QA at <strong>GeneXus</strong>, working with the security team. My tasks are
        diverse, but I specialize in automated testing and frequently work on
        test plans and regression analysisâ€”all with the goal of <strong>ensuring the
        quality</strong> of the final product.

        I am in my final year of the IT Technologist degree. Thanks to the wide
        range of projects and challenges I have tackled, I feel confident in my
        ability to<strong> take on new challenges </strong> with the versatility that defines me.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy reading and training. However, most of my spare
        time is dedicated to my true passion: software development and
        researching new technologies and trends.
