## About this project

A hospital system where patients and medical records are registered. The records can then be queried either generally or with specific parameters.

## Walkthrough

In this university assignment, along with two classmates, we faced the challenge of creating a system that used a NoSQL database service of our choice. As a team, we selected Firebase.

The task consisted of developing a backend with any technology we wanted, as long as it performed NoSQL queries. Additionally, the final result had to be delivered in Docker and include automated tests triggered by an orchestrator.

For the automated tests, I decided to create Postman scripts for backend requests. After defining the test cases, I structured a command using Newman, Postman's command-line tool.

Finally, we used Jenkins to automate the execution and generate reports of the tests run with Newman.
