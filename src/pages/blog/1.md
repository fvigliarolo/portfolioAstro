## Deploying the Backend: Beyond the Code

Ever since I started working on my application's backend, I knew the moment would come when I'd need to put it into production. This stage came with a set of challenges that weren't so much about writing code, but about diving into system administration and understanding how a server worksâ€”how to configure it, keep it secure, and ensure the application is always available.

In this post, I want to share the journey I took to bring the backend into production. I won't go into sensitive technical details (for security reasons), but I will explain what tasks were necessary, how they impacted the code, and what I learned along the way.

## First Steps with the Server

After purchasing a VPS service, the first step was connecting to the server remotely via SSH to make sure everything was up to date and to perform basic maintenance tasks. From there, I began preparing the environment needed for the backend to run in a stable and secure way.

Among other things, I took care of updating the operating system, managing users, permissions, and servicesâ€”all with the goal of creating an isolated and reliable environment to run the application.

## Choosing and Configuring the Node.js Version

Since the backend is built with Node.js, I needed a flexible way to install and manage versions. I chose a tool that allowed me to maintain multiple versions on the server and switch between them easily depending on the project's needs.

## Security: Controlling Server Access

A key part of the process was establishing basic firewall rules. I enabled the OS firewall and only allowed connections necessary for managing and running the application. This added a protective layer, limiting the system's exposure to unwanted access.

## Keeping the App Alive

A production app can't afford to stop if a process fails or the server restarts. That's why I incorporated a process manager that runs the backend in the background, restarts it automatically on errors, and keeps it active after a system reboot. There are many options out there for this, such as `pm2`, `forever`, `systemd`, among others.

## Exposing the Backend to the World

To allow other services or applications to access my backend, I set up a reverse proxy server to forward HTTP/HTTPS requests to the actual backend service. There are many solutions for this, like Nginx, Apache, or Caddyâ€”each with its own strengths depending on the case. I also added an SSL certificate to ensure that all connections were secure.

## Code Adjustments for Production

Interestingly, some of the challenges related to the production environment led me to modify parts of the code.

Due to business logic and some limitations of the hosting environment I use, I had to adapt parts of the backend.

One of the changes involved adjusting the access control system (CORS) to only allow requests from specific domains. This required restructuring how the *whitelist* was defined and how the backend decided which database to use for each origin.

These changes weren't trivial, but they ultimately helped me create a much more flexible and secure structure for the backend.

## Conclusion

Deploying an application's backend is a task that goes far beyond simply uploading code to a server. It involves understanding how the operating system works, configuring supporting services, securing the environment, and adapting the code to function properly in that context.

It can all seem overwhelming at first, but every step is an opportunity to learn something new and get a better grasp of the ecosystem where our software lives. Today, I can say it was totally worth it.

If you're going through a similar process, my advice is: take it slow, try to understand what you're doing at each step, and don't be afraid to tweak your code to fit the realities of the production environment. It's all part of the journey ðŸ’»ðŸš€
